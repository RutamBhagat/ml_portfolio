## Key Features

- **Profile Analysis**: Automated system that analyzes social media profiles using LangGraph and custom tools
- **Custom Icebreakers**: Generates personalized conversation starters based on profile data
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Supports various social media platforms through web scraping
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extensible to include additional data sources and language models

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js for a responsive user interface
- **Backend**: FastAPI for efficient request handling
- **AI Integration**: LangChain, LCEL, LangGraph for AI processing
- **External Tools**: TavilyAPI for web search, jina.ai for persons data
- **Development Tools**: Python for backend processing

## Challenges and Learnings

The development process provided valuable insights into:

- Integrating multiple data sources and LLMs into a cohesive application
- Creating custom agents and tools for LangGraph
- Optimizing web scraping for reliability and performance
- Implementing async processing and caching mechanisms

## Optimizations

1. **Caching System**

   - Implemented profile and webpage caching to reduce redundant requests
   - Improved response times through efficient data storage

2. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Concurrent handling of web scraping and data processing
   - Enhanced system responsiveness and scalability

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the TalkSpark application locally.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine.
- Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for JavaScript package management.
- Install [Pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) for Python package management.

### Clone the Repositories

1. **Clone the Frontend Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RutamBhagat/talk_spark_frontend
   cd talk_spark_frontend
   ```

2. **Environment Setup for Frontend**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `talk_spark_frontend` directory.
   - Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file.

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install Bun globally
   npm install -g bun

   # Install frontend dependencies
   bun install
   ```

4. **Start the Frontend Development Server**
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

5. **Clone the Backend Repository**
   ```bash
   cd ..  # Go back to the previous directory
   git clone https://github.com/RutamBhagat/talk_spark_langgraph
   cd talk_spark_langgraph
   ```

6. **Environment Setup for Backend**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `talk_spark_langgraph` directory.
   - Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file.

7. **Install Backend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install PDM for Python dependency management
   pipx install pdm

   # Install backend dependencies
   pdm install
   ```

8. **Start the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   pdm run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

## Outcome

TalkSpark successfully demonstrates the practical application of AI in facilitating human connections. The system provides efficient, personalized conversation starters while maintaining scalability and performance through optimized processing techniques.
